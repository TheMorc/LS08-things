# LS2008MP
What is (Farming) Landwirtschafts Simulator 2008 Multiplayer?

Well, the name says it all, it's a fan made modification that adds multiplayer support to LS2008.
It's based on LuaSockets and a clever lua inject "technology" that is supposed to be compatible with every single modpack or version of the game.

It's working somehow right now but it's still not all synced as it should and lacks many, many features.

## List of things
| Function                  | Implemented | Working |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------|
| GUI buttons | yes | yes
| Basic client/server connect | yes  | nearly flawlessly|
| Server savegame sync | yes | yes |
| Vehicle movement | yes | it's a bit laggy and jumpy
| Game time and weather | yes | yes but no timescale (time drifting between clients)
| Player nicknames | yes | yes
| Chat | yes | yes
| Lights sync | yes | likes to skip a bit
| Lowering implements | yes | yes
| Attached implements update | yes | yes
| Attaching implements | yes | pretty reliably
| Trailer sync | partially | yes
| Combine pipe, lowering cutter etc | yes | yes
| Trailer sync | yes | yes
| Mission stats | partially | only money syncs
| Basic sound sync | yes | but it's static
| Refuel sync | not planned yet
